Hello all,

I wanted to give some useful tips for success with setting up these labs for your own learning and testing purposes.  

1. Kali Linux - Ultra Distrubution recomended, more pen test tools and software pre-loaded which is less setup work
2. Install Spyder or your favorite Python IDE
    More Info here: https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html
3. Load Scapy Library for Packet Capture
    scapy can be loaded using "pip install scapy" or "sudo apt install scapy"
4. Install Wireshark (Kali Ultra includes)
    Cmd: "sudo apt-get install wireshark"
5. Install TShark (Kali Ultra includes)
    Cmd: "sudo apt-get -y install tshark"
6. Call your IDE in my case using "anaconda navigator" brings up IDE tools.
7. From here you can tweak and excute programs, recommend using Call as root, or you can test via commandline using example in tips section bellow.
8. The easiest way for a begginer to test your modifications is to use Armaggedon in Kali which will allow you to run different attacks against your own lab
    AP, then you can monitor from a VM or Lab PC using the custom tools.  Armageddon allows you to quickly run deauths, beacon floods, and many others, to test 
    ARP spoof detection recomend using the arpspoof command line program.  
    command example "arpspoof -i <network adapter> -r -t <victim IP address> <gateway IP address>"
    
9.  If you want to try Command Line using Aircrack-ng this link has useful info on how to do it:
    https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=cracking_wpa



** If your not using Kali you will want to load Aircrack-ng tools which are used for some modules.

Adtl Tips:

If Using Virtual Machine like Virtual Box, I found that only a USB wireless device will work for monitor mode / packet.  If running native hardware this should
not be a problem.  I used an AWUS1900 which worked great.  The Pen Test hardware can be a spare laptop, desktop with wireless adapter etc.  Recomend using Kali for
this as well since you will have many tools readily availble.  Please refrence this resource for how to setup in a VirtualBox VM session:
https://docs.alfa.com.tw/Support/Kali_Linux/Running_Kali_Linux_in_VirtualBox/

Use command "ifconfig" to determine your wireless interface

Anaconda Navigator - Calls IDE programs

python3 can call each module individually for testing, example "python3 deauthdetect.py"

scapy can be loaded using "pip install scapy" or "sudo apt install scapy"

Enjoy your Lab Experiments.
