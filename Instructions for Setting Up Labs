Hello all,

I wanted to give some useful tips for success with setting up these labs for your own learning and testing purposes.  

1. Kali Linux - Ultra Distrubution recomended, more pen test tools and software pre-loaded which is less setup work
2. Install Spyder or your favorite Python IDE
    More Info here: https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html
3. Load Scapy Library for Packet Capture
    scapy can be loaded using "pip install scapy" or "sudo apt install scapy"
4. Install Wireshark (Kali Ultra includes)
    Cmd: "sudo apt-get install wireshark"
5. Install TShark (Kali Ultra includes)
    Cmd: "sudo apt-get -y install tshark"
6. Call your IDE in my case using "anaconda navigator" brings up IDE tools.



** If your not using Kali you will want to load Aircrack-ng tools which are used for some modules.

Adtl Tips:

Use command "ifconfig" to determine your wireless interface

Anaconda Navigator - Calls IDE programs

python3 can call each module individually for testing, example python3 deauthdetect.py

scapy can be loaded using "pip install scapy" or "sudo apt install scapy"

Enjoy your Lab Experiments.
