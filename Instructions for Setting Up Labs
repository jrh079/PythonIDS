Hello all,

I wanted to give some useful tips for success with setting up these labs for your own learning and testing purposes.  

Kali Linux - Ultra Distrubution recomended, more pen test tools and software pre-loaded which is less setup work
Install Spder or your favorite Python IDE
Load Scapy Library for Packet Capture
Install Wireshark (Kali Ultra includes)
Install TShark (Kali Ultra includes)


If your not using Kali you will want to load Aircrack-ng tools which are used for some modules.

Tips:

Use command "ifconfig" to determine your wireless interface
Anaconda Navigator - Calls IDE programs
python3 can call each module individually for testing, example python3 deauthdetect.py

scapy can be loaded using pip install scapy or sudo cmd
